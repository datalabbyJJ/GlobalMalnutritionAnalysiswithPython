<Global Malnutrition Analysis with Python>

Objectives:

Identify causes of malnutrition
Highlight specific countries with different types of nutrition circumstance


Answers to below questions to analyze global nutrition trends.
1.Considering only plant products, what proportion of the global domestic supply is used as :
food
feed
losses
other uses
2.How many humans on earth could be fed if all the plant-based food supply (crops), including food and feed, was used for human consumption? Give the results in terms of calories, and protein. Express these two results as a percentage of the world's population.
3.How many humans could be fed with the global food supply? Give the results in terms of calories and protein. Express these two results as a percentage of the world's population.
4.From the collected data on undernutrition, what proportion of the world's population is considered undernourished?
5.Considering the 25 items most exported by the countries with a high rate of undernutrition, which three of them:
Have the greatest other_uses to domestic_supply_quantity ratio and what are they used for?
Have the greatest feed to (food+feed) ratio and what are they used for?
6.Taking only grains (cereals) for food and feed into account, what proportion (in terms of weight) is used for feed?
7.How many tons of grains (cereals) could be released if the US reduced its production of animal products by 10%? Convert this quantity to kcal, and the number of potentially fed humans.
8.In Thailand, what proportion of cassava is exported? What is the proportion of undernutrition?

Finally, try to answer the following business questions Based on trend analysis: 
1.Is the number of chronic undernutrition decreasing or increasing?
2.Is world hunger due to a lack of production?
3.What is the projected population size in 2050(these could be found on external research). Will we need to drastically increase food production?
